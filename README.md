# Jazz Music Generator
Using TensorFlow and Restricted Boltzmann Machine, we trained the model on all good old Jazz Progressions and generated new music that resembles jazz. 

# Libraries Used:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* glob
* TQDM
* Midi
* TensorFlow

Running generate_chords.py will generate the chord samples which can be converged into one MIDI file to generate the final generated chord progression. 

Any suggestions on improving the Sample generation method is much appreciated. Generating a complete song using TensorFlow would require much more complex design that takes into account every aspect of the Key, notes and time-intervals of a song. Feel free to reach out if anyone wants to contribute.
